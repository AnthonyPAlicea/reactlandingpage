  <p>React is a skill that can get you a job. But most courses out there aren't teaching it to you properly.</p>
  <p>Following along and mimicing someone typing code won't help you when faced with new problems and challenges in real world jobs.</p>
  <p>This course is different.</p>

  <h2>What This Course Isn't</h2>
  <p>
    This course is not a "follow along with me while we build projects" course. Yes, we build a fun project in the course (we recreate a popular online word game called "Spelling Bee"). However those courses are a trap.

  <h2>Watch The First 6 Hours For Free</h2>
  <p>
    I don't believe in asking you to just trust that the course is for you. But I'm very confident it will help you. For those two reasons, I put the first 6 hours of the course for free on my YouTube channel. So if you aren't sure, start watching!
